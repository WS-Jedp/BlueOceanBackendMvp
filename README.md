# Blue Ocean ðŸŒŠ 

Blue Ocean is a digital version tool of the tools and concepts of the Book *The Strategy of the Blue Ocean* by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgue.  

Made with love from Med, Col ðŸš€

## Stack
This repository is just an small version (MVP) of a future project that will implement more of the concepts of the book.  
So this part of the project is just the backend part that was built completly with PHP without any library.

## How to Install
Because the project is made with PHP you can use multiple ways to run the project, I recommend you to use PHP server to run it locally.  
In this project we don't use any library is just native and pure PHP with the Autoload feature. So you may want run `composer dump` before to run the project.
### How To Run
Is really important that you have MySQL installed and configure the properties of the *MySQL* class where is in *App/Databases/MySQL*.  
Once you configured the MySQL data you can run the project with the next command inside of the *public* folder:  

- `php -S localhost:3000`
